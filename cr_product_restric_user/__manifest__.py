        The Product Restriction on Users Odoo App is designed to provide businesses with greater control over product 
        visibility within the Odoo system. This app allows administrators to restrict access to specific products or 
        product categories based on the roles and permissions of individual users. By assigning particular products or 
        product categories to users, businesses can streamline their sales processes, limit access to sensitive items, 
        and prevent unauthorized sales.
